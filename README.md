# Goeko

Goeko is a grasshopper plugin for fetching and calculating LCA data. Goeko uses Ökobaudat - database published by the German state which provides EPD. It is a publicly accessible platform that allows users to search for EPD based on various requirements.

# Example usage

Run the [read-epd.gh](https://github.com/Curiosit/goeko.gha/blob/main/gh-examples/read-epd.gh) example to load EPDs from Ökobaudat library, parse it and read the numerical data.
